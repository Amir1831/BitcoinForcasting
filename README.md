The series of expriments that you see in this notebook:


| Model Number | Model Type | Horizon size | Window size | Extra data |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| 0 | NaÃ¯ve model (baseline) | NA | NA | NA |
| 1 | Dense model | 1 | 7 | NA |
| 2 | Same as 1 | 1 | 30 | NA | 
| 3 | Same as 1 | 7 | 30 | NA |
| 4 | Conv1D | 1 | 7 | NA |
| 5 | LSTM | 1 | 7 | NA |
| 6 | Same as 1 (but with multivariate data) | 1 | 7 | Block reward size |
| 7 | [N-BEATs Algorithm](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10437.pdf) | 1 | 7 | NA |
| 8 | Ensemble (multiple models optimized on different loss functions) | 1 | 7 | NA | 
| 9 | Future prediction model (model to predict future values) | 1 | 7 | NA| 
| 10 | Same as 1 (but with turkey ðŸ¦ƒ data introduced) | 1 | 7 | NA |

* **horizon** = number of timesteps to predict into future
* **window** = number of timesteps from past used to predict **horizon**
